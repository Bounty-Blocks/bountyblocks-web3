# BountyBlocks (Web3 portion)

## Project Overview
BountyBlocks began as an on-chain bug bounty platform and has evolved into a web3 Verifiable Bounty Ledger (VBL).

We strengthen transparency and community. With BountyBlocks:
 - Sponsors prevent and identify vulnerabilities from disrupting their products.
 - Ethical hackers remediate issues for monetary rewards (e.g., USDF bounties) and reputational rewards (NFT credentials) staying anonymous while proving capability.

Our solution is token-agnostic: sponsors fund in one asset; hackers claim in another via on-chain swaps. The VBL automates quotes, routing, slippage, records assets, rates, and proofs for audit.

Built on Flow for programmable issue management and atomic payouts, and Walrus for privacy-preserving evidence and selective disclosure, BountyBlocks delivers an end-to-end, transparent, auditable bounty workflow.


## Tech Stack
 - Code in this repository deploys Cadence smart contracts and a Flow Sink/Swap agent on Flow TestNet.
